# DDPG Cart-Pole

This is my implementation of the DDPG algorithm in a classic, custom cart-pole
environment created by my mentor Dr. Domen Å oberl.
Some pre-trained weights are to be found here, which can be used.
Important to note, there are some "flags" to be found in the "util" module, with
which certain logs can be controled (also the ones added subsequently, if
necessary), as well as rendering and recording.

## Required packages

This is not a comprehensive list of all the packages used in this project, however,
the packages listed are the minimum required to run the project.

### TensorFlow GPU

Use conda (miniconda3) to install TensorFlow and all its dependencies - as
per the official instructions found on TensorFlow website.

### tf-agents

Install `tf-agents` via pip WITHIN the conda environment where TensorFlow is set up.

### gymnasium (optional: used for starting the example)

Install `gymnasium` via pip - can be a global install (unspecific to the conda environment).

### tkinter

Install `tkinter` via pip - can be a global install (unspecific to the conda environment).

### pygame

Install `pygame` via pip - can be a global install (unspecific to the conda environment).

### numpy

Install `numpy` via pip - can be a global install (unspecific to the conda environment).

## Instructions

The project is structured so that its components are grouped into modules.
The main module is the *ddpg*, where the DDPG class and the main implementation
of the algorithm in the custom Cart-Pole environment are stored, in `ddpg.py`
and `cartpole.py` respectively.
Therefore, the recommended way of running the main cartpole.py is:

```python
python3 -m ddpg.cartpole
```

*(In my case, for Debian based distro, the "python3" command is used - otherwise for RPM, Arch based distros use "python")*

Similarly, running any other file from the project follows the same scheme e.g. **python3 -m example.pendulum**.
